# Data like you would not believe.

So a few things so far, the site updating tends not to...update. Just finished a quick paragraph on the intention of this site, which was to test the AI approach, and glad I didn't spend too much time on it as all the progress has vanished. 

Filters are having a heck of a time figuring out the composition of the image and wanting to adopt the color scheme as the corresponding filter color. 

Also noticed the image editing mode is attempting to assess the contrast and shades in the images that are uploaded. This is exciting, if the editing can become more robust at learning image composition.

Current format I am on is starting to have a better vibe to it. Just loaded a new post with a higher res image to see what it'll do with it.
