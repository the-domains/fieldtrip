**Intent**

The purpose of Field Trip is to provide a resource to anyone who is curious about how to keep learning throughout their life. By learning, I mean acquiring new skills or information that is beneficial to your calling or career. It doesn't matter if you are a seasoned expert with decades of experience or a high school freshman trying to figure out what major you want to take. The point is to find the best resources available to help you find your way.
